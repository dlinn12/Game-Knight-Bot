I always feel more intelligent after reading your work.
It’s really difficult to underestimate you.
Your haircut makes your nose look smaller.
You look really nice in this light.
That’s a great photo of you. I didn’t recognize you at first.
You’re not as dumb as you look.
I love how you just don’t care what anyone thinks of you.
I don’t care what others say about you. You’re alright in my book.
I didn’t expect you to get the job - Congratulations!
I wish I was as relaxed as you are about messiness.
You’re so charming when you make an effort.
Your house feels so cozy and lived in.
Well, that’s a level of incompetence I’ve never seen before.
You’re pretty… on the inside.
That’s not the ugliest shirt I’ve seen you wear.
You might not be the most handsome, but you’re definitely the funniest!
You clean up nice.
You’re smarter than two dumb guys.
You are not stupid. I just think you have bad luck when thinking!
Bless your heart!
You're going to make some cats very happy someday.
Don't worry so much
You are surprinsingly resourceful!
